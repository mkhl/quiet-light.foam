Quiet Light is an Espresso theme using a light background and color scheme.
To install, move the file Quiet Light.css into your `~/Library/Application
Support/Espresso/Themes` folder and relaunch Espresso.

I created Quiet Light because I wasn't happy with Espresso's default theme or
with any of the numerous dark themes available.  It currently has good HTML
and CSS support, mediocre PHP support, and absolutely terrible Javascript
support (partly thanks to the Javascript syntax's lack of specific definition
zones).  As I continue to refine the theme, I'll be keeping it up to date
here.  Please feel free to contribute yourself, particularly if there's a
language that you'd like to see supported.
